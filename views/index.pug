h1 Knowledge Base UI demo
p
    | This demo allows the user to search a list of articles and filter the results by related tags.
    | The server also returns search string suggestions onkeyup. These suggestions are mocks, as the
    | server performs no actual analysis and just returns the search strings that have been stored during
    | the current server instance.
p
    | The server runs on node/express. The UI is written in three different frameworks. Pug is used for
    | templating.
p
    | I decided to showcase the bare bones process of creating a server, establishing basic data models
    | and user interactions, iterating on a prototype, and refining into a deliverable. I also am demonstrating
    | framework versatility/agnosticism.
